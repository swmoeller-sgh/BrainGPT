        {'Answer': 'A viable system model is a conceptual framework developed by British scientist 
        and cybernetician Stafford Beer to help organizations design and manage their operations. 
        It is based on the idea that organizations are complex systems that need to be managed 
        in a holistic way in order to be successful. The model consists of five subsystems
        : environment, operations, control, information, and decision-making.'

    {'What is environment?': 
        {'Answer': 'The environment subsystem of the viable system model is the subsystem that 
        monitors and responds to external changes in the environment. It is responsible for 
        gathering information about the external environment and providing feedback to the other 
        subsystems.'

        {'Answer': 'The environment subsystem of the viable system model provides feedback 
        to the other subsystems by monitoring external changes and providing information 
        about the external environment. This information can be used to inform decisions and 
        strategies within the other subsystems.'
