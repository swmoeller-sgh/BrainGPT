# Purpose

The purpose of this document is to clarify key concepts related to vector representation, vector stores, and their correlation with Language Models (LLM) in the context of making private data accessible using GPT-technologies for processing and querying.

## Concept
- **Text Corpus Ingestion**: The private text corpus is processed to create vector representations (embeddings) of the text data. These embeddings capture the semantic and syntactic relationships within the text.
- **Query Embedding**: When a question is asked to the chatbot, the question text is also converted into an embedding, ensuring it's in the same numerical format as the corpus embeddings.
- **Similarity Search**: The retriever component conducts a similarity search in the vector database (Vector Store) using the query's embedding as a reference. This search identifies the embeddings in the database that are most similar to the query embedding.
- **Answer Generation**: Once the relevant embeddings are retrieved from the Vector Store, the Language Model (LLM) processes these embeddings to generate a coherent and well-structured answer to the user's question. The LLM leverages the semantic information captured in the embeddings to provide meaningful responses.

### What is a Vector?
A **vector**, also known as an **embedding**, is an array of numbers that can represent various types of complex data, including text, images, audio, or video. In the context of text, these vector representations are designed to capture both semantic and syntactic relationships between words. This enables algorithms to understand and process language more effectively.

Specifically, **word embeddings** are dense vector representations that encode the meaning of individual words based on their context within a large corpus of text. In simpler terms, they map words to numerical vectors in a high-dimensional space, where similar words are positioned closer to each other. They capture semantic relationships between words by learning from a large corpus of text. and are trained on contextual information to understand how words relate to each other. These word embeddings are stored in a vector database, which is also referred to as a **vector store**.
The generation of these embeddings is carried out by an **embedding model**, and there are various embedding models available for this purpose such as  Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText.

#### Purpose of the Vector Store
The **Vector Store** serves as a repository for storing and retrieving vector representations of text data in a numerical format. This numerical representation is efficient for storage and retrieval. It plays a crucial role in numerous natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as:

- Finding similar documents.
- Conducting text-based searches.
- Generating relevant responses.
In essence, the Vector Store is where you store the vector representations of a corpus of text data. This corpus can encompass a wide range of textual content, including documents, articles, chat logs, and more. The vector representations stored in the Vector Store enable you to measure the similarity between different pieces of text. This capability is invaluable for tasks such as content recommendation, identifying related articles, or suggesting similar user-generated content.

#### Correlation with Language Models (LLM)
A **Language Model (e.g., GPT)** primarily focuses on generating human-like text based on input. However, it lacks the inherent capability to perform rapid and efficient similarity searches or document retrieval. This is where the Vector Store comes into playâ€”it complements the Language Model by providing the necessary tools for quick text data comparison and retrieval.

While the Language Model can generate text, it does not inherently offer a way to measure the similarity between distinct pieces of text.

By leveraging the Vector Store in conjunction with the Language Model, you can create recommendation systems and content discovery mechanisms that significantly enhance user experiences.

This synergy between the Vector Store and Language Models enables a wide range of applications, from content recommendations to advanced search capabilities, ultimately making private data accessible for processing and querying using GPT-based technologies.
